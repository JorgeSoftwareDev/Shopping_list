# Shopping List Project

This project is a simple shopping list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, remove, and manage their shopping items. The application persists data using LocalStorage and is deployed on Netlify.

## Features

- **Add items to list via Form**: Users can add new items to the shopping list using a simple input form.
- **Remove items from list by clicking the "X" button**: Each item in the list has an "X" button that allows users to remove it.
- **Clear all items with "Clear" button**: A button to clear all items from the list.
- **Filter the items by typing in the filter field**: Users can filter the items in the list by typing in the filter field.
- **LocalStorage to persist items**: The application uses LocalStorage to save the list items, so they persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
- **Edit mode**: Users can click on an item to put it into "edit mode" and update the item in the form.
- **Deploy to Netlify**: The application is deployed to Netlify for easy access and sharing.
